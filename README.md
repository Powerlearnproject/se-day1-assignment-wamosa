# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

##Software engineering
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software. It ensures that software is scalable, reliable, and maintainable, playing a crucial role in modern technology-driven industries such as healthcare, finance, and telecommunications.

## Milestones in software engineering

1950s-1960s: Birth of Software Engineering    – The term "software engineering" was first introduced to address the software crisis, where large projects were failing due to poor planning and lack of structure.

1970s-1980s: Structured Programming and SDLC – Introduction of structured programming techniques and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models like Waterfall.

1990s-Present: Agile and DevOps – Agile methodologies revolutionized software development with iterative and flexible approaches. DevOps emerged to integrate development and operations for faster deployment.

## Phases of SDLC

Planning – Define project scope and feasibility.

Requirement Analysis – Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.

Design – Create architecture and system design.

Implementation (Coding) – Develop the actual software.

## waterfall VS agile methodology

The Waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequential path, where each stage of software development must be completed before moving to the next. This makes it a strong choice for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, such as building a simple data processing system where the needs are unlikely to change. Conversely, Agile methodologies embrace an iterative and flexible approach, allowing for adjustments and refinements throughout the development process. This adaptability makes Agile ideal for projects with evolving or uncertain requirements, like developing a mobile app, where user feedback and market shifts necessitate frequent changes.

## Roles and Responsibilities
Software Developer: Writes code.   
Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software.   
Project Manager: Oversees project execution.   

## IDEs and VCS:
IDEs improve code efficiency while VCs manage code  versions and collaborations
## Common  challenges 
- changing requirements
- technical debt
- Team communication
## types of testing
- Unit: Tests individual code components.
- Integration: Tests interactions between components.
- System: Tests the entire system
- Acceptance: Verifies that the system meets user requirements.
- Importance: They ensure software quality and reliability.
## AI and Prompt engineering
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting precise and effective instructions, or "prompts," to guide AI models towards generating desired outputs.
A vague prompt, such as "Write something about history," leaves an AI model with an overwhelming range of possibilities, leading to potentially broad and unfocused responses. In contrast, an improved prompt like "Write a concise summary of the key causes of the French Revolution, focusing on economic and social factors" is far more effective
